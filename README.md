# hiit-coach

This is a super simple robotic coach for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workouts.  
It verbally tells you what exercise you're on, and how much time is left in the interval, and provides semi-scripted encouragement.
Just find your favorite workout music to play in the background, and hit run.  
Switch up the excercises, add more cycles, make it match your routine.
To start your workout, in your terminal enter "python3 start_workout.py".
